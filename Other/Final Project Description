Final Project Description

For my final, I will design a page based on the existing design that Spotify currently uses.  But I will also be applying a "functional" page that will include the 'Spotify Playlist Awards'.  The page will show a few examples of top categories and will (hopefully) include a part where people can vote on certain playlists and even make submissions.

The layout of the page will look similar to what Spotify looks on a web browser but instead of showing discovered pages or personnal playlists, it will show the categories of various playlists that have been voted to the top.
